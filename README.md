# Maps
My works and contributions in Agoda's mobile-application map redesign and exploration as a UX Prototyper Intern in collaboration with UX Designers, UX Researchers, and Product Owners during summer 2017.

This redesign exploration aims to improve the map's functionality and user-experience, so the icons and visuals are not the main concern.

The following prototypes are made using: Sketch, Adobe Illustrator, FramerJS, and MapboxGL JS.

# Current Key Issues with Agoda's Mobile Application Map
1. Property pins show insufficient information; this forces the user to zoom-in or click on pins to reveal more information, most importantly, pricing.

2. Upon selecting a property pin, property information card appears at selected location, covering up neigbouring properties thus preventing users from conveniently comparing nearby property prices.

# Steps Taken to Address the Issues
1. Pin redesign: new pin is introduced to contain property price, which is believed to be the most important information for customers when it comes to choosing a property. However, larger pin means that pins would be cluttered and overlapping at lower zoom levels, so this was another problem to consider in the exploration.

2. Implementation of property cards: property cards appear upon selection at the bottom of the screen to not obstruct neighbouring properties.

With those fixes in mind and 10 total explorations made, we proposed 2 concepts.
